# vtcmanager-web
VTCManager is a powerful Euro Truck Simulator 2 tool. We are building something more than only a simple job logger. Together we can build something awesome! <br>
IMPORTANT: Currently, this is only a developement alpha. Only use this for developement purposes as a communication with our services is required and may result in issues.
