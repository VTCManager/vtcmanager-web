# vtcmanager-web
VTCManager is a powerful Euro Truck Simulator 2 tool. We are building something more than only a simple job logger. Together we can build something awesome! <br>
IMPORTANT: We recommend to not cancel the communications to the VTCManager-Server as it may result in major issues, limit the operability and functionality. Currently, this is only a development alpha. Only use this for development purposes as communication with our services is required and may result in issues. Additionally, plesa contact `_joschi03_#3193` n Discord to gain access to our beta website as the registration is currently disabled while the new version is still in development.
